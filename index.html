<h2 id="myfamily">My family</h2>
<p>Furthermore, I am the youngest of a family of 5. My dads name is <b>Carlos Galarza</b> and my mothers is <b> Annette Valentin</b>. I have two older sisters, the eldest is <b> Jacqueline Galarza</b> and the other is <b> Karyann Galarza</b>. </p> 
<p>This is a fairly old picture of our family but I had trouble finding a more recent one. Anyways, my parents are the two on the left and my eldest sister <i> Jacqueline</i> is the one that is next to me with the long black hair and bangs and <i>Karyann</i> is the one sitting in the middle with the bangs and short blonde hair.</p>

<h4> My best friend</h4>
<img src="images/amber.jpg" width="200" height="300"> 
<p>My best friend's name is <b>Amber</b> and she is a little older than I am but it doesnt matter because she is like a sister to me. I met her when I first moved to <i>Texas</i> and we clicked since the first time we ever spoke. Since then we have been inseperable and we have been through it all together. A few years ago she moved with her husband to Canada and lived there for a couple of years and now she lives with him and her family. Although, she isn't physically here with me we are always there for each other and anytime I have a problem I know I can always count on her.

<h5>My friend</h5>
<img src="images/cassie.jpg" width="300" height="300"> 
<p> Another close friend of mine that does live here is called <b>Cassandra</b>. We have sleepovers a lot and we hang out as much as we are able to. Sometimes in between our classes we meet up to chill together. She is really funny we joke a lot together, especially when we watch movies somehow we always make a joke out of everything. However, if the moment comes to it we can always talk seriously as well, which is nice. She is one of the first people I met when I moved to <i>Texas</i> as well. <i>Amber, Cassandra</i> and I all went to high school together. So we all know each other and talk to each other, which is awesome.</p>

<h6 id="myboyfriend"> My boyfriend</h6>
<img src="images/edrick.jpg" width="300" height="300"> 
<p> My boyfriend's name is <b>Edrick</b> and I first met him in <i>Puerto Rico</i>. We went to school together in elementary and middle school up until I moved to <i>Texas</i>. He was actually my first ever guy friend and my childhood crush, it's funny how the world works. I liked him when I was younger but he didn't like me. After long years of us never speaking to each other since I moved over here. Last year we were reunited thanks to the power of social media. It turned out he also moved from <i>Puerto Rico</i> but he moved to <i> New York</i> where he resides currently. Anyways, we began talking and flirting and then he decided to come to visit me and we got together. He is the best boyfriend I have ever had and I am really grateful to have him in my life. Although, like my best friend he also lives far away we make this long distance thing work.
